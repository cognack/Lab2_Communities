# Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will play with unsupervised classification techniques while working with ecological community datasets.
  
 - **Ordination** orders sites near each other based on similarity. It is a multivariate analysis technique used to effectively collapse dependent axes into fewer dimensions, i.e. dimensionality reduction.
    - **Principal Components Analyses (PCA)** is the most common and oldest technique that assumes linear relationships between axes. You will follow a non-ecological example from [Chapter 17 Principal Components Analysis | Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/pca.html) to learn about this commonly used technique.
    - **Non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS)** allows for non-linear relationships. This ordination technique is implemented in the R package [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html). Youâ€™ll use an ecological dataset, species and environment from lichen pastures that reindeer forage upon, with excerpts from the vegantutor vignette (source) to apply these techniques:
      - **Unconstrained ordination** on species using NMDS;
      - Overlay with environmental gradients; and
      - **Constrained ordination** on species and environment using another ordination technique, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)
